#### Hardware

I use a 13" 16GB Macbook Pro (M1 Apple Silicon) with 3 27" 4k Dell screens attached (using a Lenovo docking staging). My 2017 8-core 32gb iMac Pro serves as a build machine and to run things the M1 cannot do well at this point like Docker.

#### Software

I've been automating my computer setups for years. I created [Kitchenplan (Chef based)](https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan) and [Superlimuc (Ansible based)](https://github.com/superlumic/superlumic) and used them for years to go from a clean install to operational in less than an hour. Recently I switched to [a pure ZSH dotfiles](https://github.com/roderik/dotfiles) setup. Not feature complete but currently 100% ARM native.

For development I switch between VS Code Insiders and IntelliJ IDEA. I love the regular Terminal (fast,stable,already there) and I have a [ctrl-ctrl hotkey](https://github.com/roderik/roderik) defined in [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) to show and hide it.
