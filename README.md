#### Hardware

I'm using the 2017 8-core 32gb iMac Pro with 2 Dell U2718Q 4k screens attached. As a mobile unit I use a 13" 16GB Macbook Pro (M1 Apple Silicon) and i'm even using Teleport to control the iMAC from the Macbook. I use the Macbook in front with the keyboard and trackpad of the Macbook and above it the iMac with the two screens to either side. If at some point I clean up my desk i will add a picture 🤣

#### Software

I've been automating my computer setups for years. I created [Kitchenplan (Chef based)](https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan) and [Superlimuc (Ansible based)](https://github.com/superlumic/superlumic) and used them for years to go from a clean install to operational in less than an hour. Recently I switched to [a pure ZSH dotfiles](https://github.com/roderik/dotfiles) setup. Not feature complete but currently 100% ARM native.

For development I switch between VS Code Insiders and IntelliJ IDEA. I love the regular Terminal (fast,stable,already there) and I have a ctrl-ctrl hotkey defined in [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) to show and hide it.
